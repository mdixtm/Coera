Ideas of improvement:

- add more exception handling in service (eg. null check, try catch blocks)
- additional tests for exceptions
- additional tests for caching
- add extra caching (eg. some distributed caching maybe when needed) or think better at the caching constraints
- add indexing on the database on most searched items - ex: email
- add logging (log exception + debugging logging)
- add authorization
- add multiple validation for fields (eg: phone number)
- create separate DTO/Database models
- remove seeding or use it just for developement evironment

Assumptions:

- the required fields from customer are required in the controller input and also in the database

Total time spent in task: 5h
